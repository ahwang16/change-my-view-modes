<relation_support ref="a"> <logos> According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken </logos>. <logos> Before the chicken there was a similar but different creature. </logos> <pathos> Let's call it X. </pathos> <logos>Its completely arbitrary when the X officially evolved into a chicken </logos>, but <logos> at some point it does </logos>. <logos> An X, not a chicken lays the first chicken egg. </logos> </relation_support> <claim id="a"> The chicken egg comes before any creature considered a chicken exist. </claim> Am I wrong?

PS I'm playing laser tag soon so I will respond in 20ish minutes.

  <relation_support ref="b"> <logos> The chicken, as far as we know came into existence around [2500-2100 BC.]</logos> <ethos> (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken#Origins) </ethos>

  <logos> Egg bearing animals, however, seem to be [as old as the dinosuars] </logos> <ethos> (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_egg) </ethos> 

<logos> From this, we can conclude that the egg came first. </logos> </relation_support> <claim id="c"> ^Unless ^you ^are ^talking ^about ^the ^CHICKEN ^egg ^vs ^the ^chicken, ^in ^which ^case ^I ^have ^no ^clue. </claim>
