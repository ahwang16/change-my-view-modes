<logos> According to the theory of evolution it makes more sense that the egg preceded the chicken </logos>. <logos> Before the chicken there was a similar but different creature. </logos> <pathos> Let's call it X. </pathos> <logos>Its completely arbitrary when the X officially evolved into a chicken </logos>, but <logos> at some point it does </logos>. <logos> An X, not a chicken lays the first chicken egg. </logos> <claim> The chicken egg comes before any creature considered a chicken exist. </claim> Am I wrong?

PS I'm playing laser tag soon so I will respond in 20ish minutes.

  <logos> The modern domestic chicken is a hybrid of a red and grey junglefowl. </logos> <logos> The egg produced by cross-breading the two species resulted in the first chicken. </logos> Therefore, <claim> you are correct in saying that the egg came first </claim>, but <claim> your explanation is incorrect </claim>.

Interesting. I didn't know that. You may have just solved thus debacle. Where in the world did the chicken first live?

It's generally thought they originated in Asia -- India or Southeast Asia, most likely.
