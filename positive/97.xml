<title>CMV: Most democracies are far too tolerant of extremism, especially the likes of neo-fascism, neo-nazism, radical Islamism and violent intolerance. The world has been to soft on these ideologies and they need to be eliminated whenever they appear.</title>

<claim id="a"> I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes. </claim> <relation_support ref="a"> <logos> It's either the extreme left, or the extreme right. </logos> </relation_support> <relation_support ref="a"> <logos> <pathos> Radicalism almost always leads to violence, and is a plague on democratic society and governments. </pathos> </logos> </relation_support> <relation_support ref="b" <logos> Since communism has been relegated to just a handful of countries </logos> </relation_support>, <claim id="b"> the far-left has for the most part been dealt with </claim>. <claim id="c"> However the far-right continues to be a menace. </claim>

<claim id="d"> I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right. </claim> <claim id="e"> These groups are always extreme fringes </claim>, and <claim id="f"> a handful of people make the world a much nastier place </claim>.

<relation_support ref="f"> <pathos> Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power. </pathos> </relation_support>

<relation_support ref="g"> <logos> <pathos> Unfortunately with the world's obsession with free speech and personal liberty </pathos> </logos> </relation_support>, <claim id="g"> such leaders are given a free hand </claim>. <relation_support ref="h"> <logos> On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers. </logos> </relation_support> <claim id="h"> Wouldn't restricting "free speech" put brakes on this sort of recruitment ? </claim>

 <relation_support ref="i"> <logos> Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash </logos>, but <logos> do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate </logos> </relation_support> . <claim id="i"> I see this as a major flaw in democracy. </claim> <relation_support ref="i"> <logos> Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism. </logos> </relation_support>

 <logos> People thought the exact same thing before WWI. </logos> <pathos> They thought they were too civilized for what would happen in the next 50 years. </pathos> And <claim> I challenge the assertion we have moved past it considering what's happening in the middle east </claim>.

&gt; <quote> I do agree that today's moderates are potentially tomorrow's conservatives. However this isn't about being just a bit conservative. It's about people that advocate death and destruction - terrorism, genocide, ethnic cleansing and murder. </quote>

 <logos> <pathos> One person's terrorist is another person's freedom fighter. </pathos> </logos> <logos> <pathos> One's person's genocide is another person's defense of their culture. </pathos> </logos> <pathos> <logos> One person's murderer is a other's soldier. </logos> </pathos> Now, <claim> I don't think all these comparisons are true </claim>, but <claim> they certainly aren't hard to make </claim>. <claim> And they certainly have been made throughout history. </claim>

Exactly, <claim> my point there wasn't that conservatives are terrible, but that what is considered moderate and okay changes </claim>. <claim> It isn't some objective fact about people. </claim> <logos> J. S. Mill would have been considered an extreme feminist back when he wrote </logos>, but <logos> today he's very much in the center of mainline liberal thought </logos>.  <claim> The point is what people consider moderate and reasonable isn't set in stone </claim>, and <claim> to adopt a zero tolerance policy cuts too deeply and may cut in the wrong direction </claim> (<logos> either failing to get bad people or getting good people </logos>)

 <claim> Your first paragraph is intriguing </claim>, and <claim> I definitely agree with it </claim>. <claim> The freedom fighter/terrorist comparison is also an interesting perspective. </claim> <claim> Although I do think more needs to be done to combat extremism, I see where you're coming from on this. </claim>
