<title>CMV: Most democracies are far too tolerant of extremism, especially the likes of neo-fascism, neo-nazism, radical Islamism and violent intolerance. The world has been to soft on these ideologies and they need to be eliminated whenever they appear.</title>

<claim> I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes. </claim> <logos> It's either the extreme left, or the extreme right. </logos> <logos> <pathos> Radicalism almost always leads to violence, and is a plague on democratic society and governments. </pathos> </logos> <logos> Since communism has been relegated to just a handful of countries </logos>, <claim> the far-left has for the most part been dealt with </claim>. <claim> However the far-right continues to be a menace. </claim>

<claim> I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right. </claim> <claim> These groups are always extreme fringes </claim>, and <claim> a handful of people make the world a much nastier place </claim>.

<pathos> Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power. </pathos>

<logos> <pathos> Unfortunately with the world's obsession with free speech and personal liberty </pathos> </logos>, <claim> such leaders are given a free hand </claim>. On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers. <pathos> Wouldn't restricting "free speech" put brakes on this sort of recruitment ? </pathos>

 <logos> Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash </logos>, but <logos> do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate </logos> . <claim> I see this as a major flaw in democracy. </claim> <logos> Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism. </logos>

Instead, <claim> I think governments should do much more and try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism </claim>. <pathos> After the horrors of World War 2 </pathos> <claim> I find it completely absurd that we still put up with their ideologies </claim>.

<claim> Bringing socio-economic growth to communities that feel disenfranchised just isn't enough </claim> , and <pathos> <logos> their will always be a few bad apples </logos> </pathos>. <claim> These bad apples need to be weeded out </claim>. <pathos> Instead, we allow them to spread their rot, and infect society. </pathos>

As other's said, who gets to decide what these bad ideologies are.  Here's a substitution using your syntax, but modified details.

 &gt; <quote> Zero tolerance, whatever it takes. </quote>
 <claim> Schools should educate children on the dangers of jewish zionism </claim> and <claim> their poison should be kept out of the minds of children </claim>. <logos> <pathos> Young impressionable minds are the easiest targets for zionist indoctrination. </pathos> </logos>
In a highly connected online era, <pathos> it has become far too easy to recruit people into the zionist movement </pathos>. <logos> <pathos> When facebook and twitter is used to recruit zionist supporters and other jewish terrorists online en masse, there is a problem. </pathos> </logos>
 <claim> The German majority needs to grow a spine and say enough is enough. </claim>

 Now, <claim> this is obviously extreme </claim> , but <claim> you see how such an extreme zero tolerance policy can be dangerous in its inflexibility and its arbitrariness </claim>.

<claim> The thing is though, what is considered a political fringe isn't really all that subjective. </claim>

<logos> Most reasonable people think groups like the KKK, the Golden Dawn, Nazis, Militant anarchist terrorists, ISIS, Al-Qaeda and any other neo-fascist group are dangerous. </logos>

 <claim> I don't disagree </claim>, but <pathos> on principle who gets to define what being a reasonable person is </pathos>?  <logos> Stalin thought non-stalinists were dangerous </logos>, and <logos> probably a lot of Russians did too who most would consider reasonable </logos>. <pathos> Remember reasonable people actually voted Hitler into office </pathos>.

 <claim> In a stable democracy this isn't too hard to figure out. </claim> <logos> Pre-WW2 germany or Stalinist Russia weren't all that stable. </logos>

 <claim> So did they. </claim> <logos> Tyrants and tyranny are as old as politics themselves. </logos> <logos> Ever heard of the Reign of Terror? </logos>

&gt; <quote> The moderate majority of the world gets to decide the demarcations for the narrow political band around the center. </quote>

 And <pathos> who gets to decide what being a moderate was </pathos>, and <pathos> why is it tied to what the majority wants </pathos>? <logos> Todays moderates are tomorrows conservatives </logos>, and <logos> <pathos> throughout history the majority has been okay with a lot of terrible shit </pathos> </logos>.
 
 &gt;<quote> In a stable democracy this isn't too hard to figure out. </quote>

<claim> Is a democracy really that stable if it needs to censor radical ideas to stop nastiness from happening? </claim> <logos> It seems a need for censorship implies a certain degree of exposure to these ideas. </logos> Also, <pathos> <logos> stable democracies have elected terrible people too who have done terrible things </logos> </pathos>. <logos> <pathos> 100 years of reasonable people who likely were considered moderates lead a persecution of Indians from the Trial of Tears to Wounded Knee. </pathos> </logos>

 <logos> People thought the exact same thing before WWI. </logos> <pathos> They thought they were too civilized for what would happen in the next 50 years. </pathos> And <claim> I challenge the assertion we have moved past it considering what's happening in the middle east </claim>.  Hell, <logos> Rwanda wasn't that long ago either </logos>.

Exactly, <claim> my point there wasn't that conservatives are terrible, but that what is considered moderate and okay changes </claim>. <claim> It isn't some objective fact about people. </claim> <logos> J. S. Mill would have been considered an extreme feminist back when he wrote </logos>, but <logos> today he's very much in the center of mainline liberal thought </logos>.  <claim> The point is what people consider moderate and reasonable isn't set in stone </claim>, and <claim> to adopt a zero tolerance policy cuts too deeply and may cut in the wrong direction </claim> (<logos> either failing to get bad people or getting good people </logos>)

 <claim> Your first paragraph is intriguing </claim>, and <claim> I definitely agree with it </claim>. <claim> The freedom fighter/terrorist comparison is also an interesting perspective. </claim> <claim> Although I do think more needs to be done to combat extremism, I see where you're coming from on this. </claim>
