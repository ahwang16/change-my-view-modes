Really though. <relation_support ref="a"> <logos> There is an unchecked organization that spies on them 24/7 without consent. </logos> </relation_support> <relation_support ref="a"> <logos> The US has given itself license to detain and torture citizens with no trial. </logos> </relation_support> <relation_support ref="a"> <logos> The energy laws in that country allow corporations to drill where they please and, as a result, poison who they please. </logos> </relation_support> American citizens have clearly been lied to in many situations. These lies have led to events like the second gulf war. Not to mention the completely unregulated financial system. 

Honestly, none of these things have been democratically voted for, so why are Americans so deluded about this? <claim id="a"> It's not a free, democratic society by any means. </claim> <claim id="b"> It's clearly an oligarchy </claim>

<claim id="c"> A democracy is not necessarily a functional, benevolent government, nor is a democracy necessarily free. </claim> <relation_support ref="d"> <logos> The USA was intended to be a federal republic, a republic being a form of indirect democracy. </logos> </relation_support> To see if it actually *is* one (at least the "republic" part), we just need to answer a few simple questions.

  <claim id="d"> Is political power in the US held by elected officials? </claim>

  <claim id="e"> Are those officials elected in free and fair democratic elections? </claim>

  <claim id="f"> The answer to both of those questions is unambiguously "yes." </claim> <relation_support ref="f"> <logos> The domestic spying, the secret courts, the torture, the corporate favoritism, the environmental destruction, the lies, the unjustified wars, the unregulated financial system... all of those are things instituted or approved by our democratically elected officials, fully within the scope of power ceded to them by the constitution. </logos> </relation_support> And <relation_support ref="f"> <logos> we continue to vote those who do these things into office in free and fair elections, time and time again, without fail </logos> </relation_support> .

  <claim id="g"> You can argue, perhaps successfully, that the US is a fascist, un-free state </claim>, but <claim id="h"> it remains by definition a democratic one </claim> .

  <relation_agreement ref="h"> <claim id="i"> Fair enough haha. </claim> </relation_agreement> <claim> This is the best argument I've seen here </claim>

Edit: but how can you have truly fair elections if things like superpacs exist?

What's your basis for believing that SuperPACs make elections un-free or un-fair?

  <claim id="j"> Well in my brain a fair election is when anyone can run for office. </claim> <relation_agreement ref="j"> <pathos> The fact that you need millions of dollars to do so seems unfair. </pathos> <logos> <pathos> It instantly results in a situation where only the rich can run for and hold offices. </pathos> </logos> </relation_agreement> <claim id="k"> On the municipal level I don't think superpacs are a problem, but definitely on a federal level. </claim>

Glad this has been a productive discussion. If your view has indeed been changed, please draw your attention to "The delta (∆) system" in the sidebar and award me one delta. 

<claim id="v"> The reason I think this is important is because I'm pissed off about the way things are in America </claim>, as I'm sure you are, and <claim id="w"> I always think that the best way to address a problem is to see it for what it is </claim>. <claim id="x"> America's problem isn't that it isn't a democracy </claim> ; rather, <claim id="y"> I think that America's problem is that it has fetishized democracy to the point where anything resulting from that system is accepted, even if it's corrupt and tyrannical </claim> , and <claim id="z"> that's exactly what it's turning into </claim>. <relation_support ref="y"> <logos> No, we're probably never going to get money out of politics entirely </logos> , but <logos> <pathos> corporations being able to anonymously fund entire campaigns is a major threat to healthy government, even if it isn't, strictly speaking, un-democratic </pathos> </logos> </relation_support> .

A delta for you then! (I'm new, so sorry in advance if I mess it up)

Maybe I put forward the wrong view, but <relation_agreement ref="y"> <claim id="aa"> I think you and I more or less agree that their is something fetid in the system </claim> </relation_agreement> . <relation_support ref="aa"> <pathos> I get tired of seeing people worship at the altar of the US flag </pathos> - <pathos> they seem blind to what the US government is really about </pathos> </relation_support> . 
Cheers!
